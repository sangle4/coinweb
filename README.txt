This program is a site that can show markets of cryptocurrency. 
I used big market of cryptocurrency to show the overall market flow.
Thera are several of cryptocurrency markets including upbit, bithumb and poloniex.

You can choose the market what you want to see trade flow.

I put two tables to show informations to you guys.

One of the tables is Real-time trade table.
